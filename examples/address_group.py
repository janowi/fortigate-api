"""AddressGroup examples.

- Create address-group in the Fortigate
- Get all address-groups from the Fortigate
- Get filtered address-group by name (unique identifier)
- Filter address-group by operator *equals* `==`
- Filter address-group by operator *contains* `=@`
- Filter address-group by operator *not equals* `!=`
- Update address-group data in the Fortigate
- Check for presence of address-group in the Fortigate
- Delete address-group from the Fortigate by name
- Delete address-groups from the Fortigate by filter
- Check for absence of address-group in the Fortigate
